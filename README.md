# TestRepo
My first repository for tests and experiments.

## Purpose
I have created this repository in order to have more personal praxis in work with git, markdown and programming.

## First steps
To clone the remote repository to your local device use the following comand in console:
git clone [address of your repository (for example SSH)]
